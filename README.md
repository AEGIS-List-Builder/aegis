This application will eventually be a graphql api for an A.E.G.I.S. list builder.
A.E.G.I.S. is a Combining Robot Strategy Game, see: http://zephyrworkshop.com/aegis/ 

A web ui for the api will be written eventually as well.

TODO: Write a real README ;)


# Code Style Note:
- A.E.G.I.S. uses the term 'class', which is also a central term in the ruby language, as well as a keyword.
I will use the term 'robot_class' in the source code consistently, when I mean class in the A.E.G.I.S. sense.
